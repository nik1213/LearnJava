1. Primitive Data Types
These are the most basic data types and are predefined in Java. They store simple values directly.

byte: 8-bit integer (-128 to 127)
short: 16-bit integer (-32,768 to 32,767)
int: 32-bit integer (-2^31 to 2^31-1)
long: 64-bit integer (-2^63 to 2^63-1)
float: 32-bit floating-point number (single precision)
double: 64-bit floating-point number (double precision)
char: 16-bit Unicode character (e.g., 'A', '3')
boolean: Represents true or false
2. Non-Primitive Data Types (Reference Types)
These are more complex data structures that hold references to objects or arrays.

String: Sequence of characters, e.g., "Hello". It's not a primitive type but behaves similarly.
Arrays: Used to store multiple values of the same type.
Classes/Objects: Defined using the class keyword, which allows the creation of custom data types.
Interfaces: Defines methods that classes can implement.
